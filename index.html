        <h3>My Treking Journey</h3>
        <h2>Nainital Tiffin Top Trek</h2>
        <p>When I visited India last year, I went on this trek with some of my friends. It was my first time doing trekking, and I never imagined that a 2 hour long trek would be this fun. after such a long journey we were able to watch such a beautiful scenery. Honestly one of my unforgettable travel experience. One thing I would like to suggest to people who have never been on this trek before, is you can schedule a horse riding to enjoy this trek. </p>

                <h2>Sem Mukhem Temple Trek</h2>
                <p>This was my second ever trek, I went on this trek with my family and my cousins. This place is located in my parents hometown. This place has such a beautiful view, since this place is surrounded by other mountains. It is such a calm and peaceful place. One advice I would give to people who have never been to this place is that, even though the security is pretty good you might get to see wild animals if lucky enough.</p>

                <h2>Bhadraj Temple Forest Trek</h2>
                <p>This was one of my most adventurous and scary trekking experience. We went to this trek thinking it would about 2 to 3 hours of trekking, but we didn't knew that there were 2 different routes and we ended up taking the longer route. The longer route was through literal forest and mountain which takes about 6 to 8 hours to reach the temple. It took us 6 hours and 30 minutes to reach the temple and there were no one else but me and my family wandering around the forest without any sense of direction. Even though we were scared of getting attacked by wild animals, it was a pretty amazing adventure that I will probably never forget. One advice I would give to someone who has never been to this trek would be choosing the shorter route because it is more easy but if someone wants to have a real adventure they should definitely choose the 7 hour trek. </p>
